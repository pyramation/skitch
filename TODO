BUILD with all in same dir, skitch style using git.

BUILD with npm install or sqitch siblings. You can still build many in the same git repo
because like lerna, you can publish to NPM!

*** NPM name = pg extension name = sqitch module name


- skitch init
  - should cre
- clean up extensions deps - dont just run create if exists!
- FINISH the dep resolution!

yarn add https://github.com/pyramation/pg-utils.git

works!

- [ ] set URI in projects
- [ ] how do publish lerna style?
--- [ ] publish to NPM!
--- [ ] then you can yarn add pg-utils-verify
`yarn add pg-utils-verify`
`yarn add pg-utils-utils`
--- [ ] allow to lookup inside of the skitch.json for "dependencies", and or "packages", e.g., "./packages/*"

so instead of only looking for control files, you could look in skitch.json first!
then you will end up finding some of the control files inside of the first node_modules directory.
-- careful with blocking node_modules in the glob now!


- rewrite skitch install!
- should update the .env with PGEXTENSIONS
